# Copilot General Instructions

These instructions apply to all GitHub Copilot usage in the Code Generation portion of this repository. They support the iterative, spec-driven modernization process outlined in the Code Generation README.

Before using Copilot:
- Specify the source and target programming languages in this file.
- Indicate where the Product Requirements Document (PRD) is located.

---

- Understand the project context: Review the PRD, architecture, and any relevant specs before generating or modifying code.
- Follow project conventions: Adhere to the naming conventions, code style, and architectural patterns defined in this repository.
- Work iteratively: Generate code in small, testable increments. Review, test, and refine based on feedback and updated specifications.
- Prioritize security and quality: Include input validation, error handling, and follow security best practices appropriate to the technology stack.
- Write maintainable code: Favor modular, readable, and testable code. Use clear naming and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Document thoughtfully: Add meaningful comments and documentation to help future readers and maintainers understand the code.
- Cross-reference specifications: Validate generated code against the PRD and latest specs. Update prompts and docs as the system evolves.
- Apply modern design principles: Use SOLID, separation of concerns, and other architectural best practices.
- Clarify when needed: If requirements or design direction are unclear, ask questions and confirm assumptions before proceeding.
