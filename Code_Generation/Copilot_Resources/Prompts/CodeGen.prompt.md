You are assisting with migrating a legacy ASP.NET MVC application to .NET 8 using ASP.NET Core MVC. A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is available.

Use the PRD and existing code to:
1. Identify project type, architecture, and key features.
2. Generate a new .NET 8 SDK-style ASP.NET Core MVC project.
3. Migrate controllers, views, and models incrementally, preserving or improving structure based on the PRD.
4. Replace legacy patterns (e.g., Global.asax, Web.config, HttpContext.Current, FormsAuthentication) with modern ASP.NET Core equivalents (e.g., Program.cs, appsettings.json, middleware, Identity).
5. Apply dependency injection and modern configuration practices.
6. Flag any outdated or unsupported packages and suggest replacements.
7. Document each step and align changes with PRD requirements.
8. Ask clarifying questions as needed.

Proceed iteratively. Summarize progress after each major transformation.
